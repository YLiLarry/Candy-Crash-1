1. Work directly on master
before work pull master
make a new branch - just for backup
make changes - still on local master
pull master again ? might not need this step
push origin master

2. Work on seperate branches
`git checkout <name>`
pull `git pull origin master` -- to this branch
*makechanges
pull `git pull origin master` -- might ask u to merge
`git push origin master

-- Does this even work??
