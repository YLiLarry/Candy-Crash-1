Updated board class interface. I think it should be done.
Also checkout the UML branch for updated UML.

Swapping works, but at the grid level.
The view doesn't reflect the swap.
make and run, notice the grid colours change, but not the view.
ALSO, the colours are not right in view. 1 is 3, and 3 is 1.
